# ✈️ Airline Reservation and Management System

## 🧩 Overview

The **Airline Reservation and Management System** is a **console-based application** developed in **Modern C++** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.
It simulates the comprehensive operations of an airline, including **flight management**, **bookings**, **user roles**, **maintenance tracking**, and **reporting**.

The system supports **multiple user roles** — *Administrator*, *Booking Agent*, and *Passenger* — each with role-based access to functionalities.
It ensures a smooth and secure environment for handling flights, reservations, and airline operations.
